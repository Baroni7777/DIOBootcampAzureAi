Over the next year, you will see many more of them. You take an existing product and open-source it.\\nI built a social media scheduling tool (many exist in the market) and created an open-source version.\\nThis is\\nPostiz , an open-source social media scheduling tool.\\nAnd of course, if you could help me with a star, it would be amazing.\\nThe thing about the source\\nIt\\'s open-source, and everybody can come and take your code, so what\\'s the catch?\\nOpen source is a community; when you start to push your product, thousands of developers will fork and clone it and help you on your journey.\\nIt will bring massive exposure to your product.\\nSo far, the Postiz docker has been downloaded 26k times.\\nOn the other hand, everybody can be a competitor and use your open-source solution instead of paying you, and you have to live with this.\\nSome licenses can save you, such as apache-2 or Agpl-3\\nIt means that people can\\'t compete with you without open-sourcing your code and giving you credit, but it doesn\\'t prevent commercial use.\\nSupport is harder\\nHaving an open-source repository (with docker and all) will attract many self-hosters and require much support.\\nSo far, 3-5 tickets from Coolify, Portainer, and Unraid are received daily. This is only the start; I am sure there will be more deployment platforms soon.\\nMake sure you give other contributors the respect they deserve. They will help you tremendously with support.\\nRevenue is uncertain\\nIf there is one thing developers are known for, it is not to pay for stuff if it\\'s not needed. We were born with this gene, I guess 😂\\nSo don\\'t expect developers to pay you. They\\'ll host you on Raspberry Pi or a $5 Coolify server.\\nIt\\'s important to know this.\\nThe goal of the contributors is:\\nHelp you to build the product\\nHelp you with exposure\\nBuild a fun and active community where everybody can grow\\nI can\\'t tell you how often I have seen a contributor tagging me on some X post about Postiz.\\nOr some top trending open-source article.\\nEnterprise\\nIt depends on your product, but some enterprises can use only self-hosted solutions and will pay you for your support and custom implementation.\\nThis is super important because that\\'s something only open-source solutions can offer.\\nPlay with the suitable license\\nThere are no secrets. Monetized open-source (COSS) is sometimes misused in the wrong ways, for example:\\nAdding dual licensing to the open-source, so when you use the code, you use the enterprise version and need to figure out how to remove it from the code base.\\nAdding non open-source license. You can put something like BSL, but it is not counted as \"open-source,\" and fewer people see your solution as attractive. You would need to refer to your solution as self-hosted instead.\\nHolding out on SSO - having SSO for enterprise is only considered a destructive pattern. I have discovered lately that you can find many websites like\\nSSO.tax\\nbecause SSO is a security thing. SSO can still be commercialized, but it\\'s better to take a stand like\\nTailscale , which limits seats or enterprise providers.\\nBe a part of the community; don\\'t talk like \"We. \" Say \"I\" and connect with your audience; nobody likes communicating with a corporation.\\nGo open-source. For me, it\\'s the only way to build\\nPlease help me out with a star. It would be awesome ❤️\\nhttps://github.com/gitroomhq/postiz-app\\nTop comments\\n(8)\\nSubscribe\\nPersonal\\nTrusted User\\nCreate template\\nTemplates let you quickly answer FAQs or store snippets for re-use.\\nSubmit\\nPreview\\nDismiss\\nCollapse\\nExpand\\nAnmol Baranwal\\nAnmol Baranwal\\nAnmol Baranwal\\nFollow\\nTechnical writer (500k+ Reads) • Software developer (200+ PRs) • Loves Open Source • Join my community at \"https://dub.sh/opensouls\"\\nEmail for collab\\nEmail\\nhi@anmolbaranwal.com\\nLocation\\nIndia\\nEducation\\nComputer Science\\nWork\\nTechnical Writer - open to opportunities\\nJoined\\nOct 21, 2022\\n•\\nNov 26\\nDropdown menu\\nCopy link\\nHide\\nThe best way to earn passive income :)\\nLike comment:\\nLike comment:\\n2 \\xa0likes\\nLike\\nComment button\\nReply\\nCollapse\\nExpand\\nNevo David\\nNevo David\\nNevo David\\nFollow\\nFounder of Postiz, an open-source social media scheduling tool.\\nRunning Gitroom, the best place to learn how to grow open-source tools.\\nEducation\\nDidn\\'t finish high school :(\\nPronouns\\nNev/Nevo\\nWork\\nOSS Chief @ Gitroom\\nJoined\\nFeb 23, 2022\\n•\\nNov 26\\nDropdown menu\\nCopy link\\nHide\\n🚀\\nLike comment:\\nLike comment:\\n1 \\xa0like\\nLike\\nComment button\\nReply\\nCollapse\\nExpand\\nfast-d3v\\nfast-d3v\\nfast-d3v\\nFollow\\nSoftware Developer.
